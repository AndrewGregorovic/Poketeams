# Pokéteams

## Requirements

Pokéteams requires Python 3.8 as well as all the modules listed in `requirements.txt`. To easily install all the required modules you can use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` depending on how Python is set up on your system.

An internet connection is also required for the Pokéteams to have full functionality as it needs to connect to pokeapi.co to get the data used to build teams.

It is also best to increase your terminal window size to be as close to 135w x 53h (columns x lines) as possible, at lower sizes some parts of the app will not look as intended. This is a recommendation, not a requirement!

> Note: This was created in a linux environment, so it may not run 100% correctly on another operating system.

## Installation

Getting Pokéteams set up on your local machine only takes a few simple steps
1. Download the repository by either:
    - Using the command `git clone https://github.com/AndrewGregorovic/Poketeams.git <target/directory>`
    - Downloading the zip file and unzip it to the target directory
2. Install the modules in `requirements.txt` using the commands mentioned above in [Requirements](#requirements) 
3. In your terminal run the command `<path/to>/Poketeams/src/main.py`

If you have issues running main.py as an executable use the command `python <path/to>/Poketeams/src/main.py` or `python3 <path/to>/Poketeams/src/main.py` again depending on your Python set up.

## Instructions

Using the Pokéteams app is very straightforward and uses an easy to navigate UI to improve user friendliness. Simply navigate the menus as instructed on screen, using enter to select the desired option or to confirm text input.
